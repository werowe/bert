[This Jupyter](https://github.com/werowe/bert/blob/main/lawinsider.ipynb) notebook sets up and runs a HuggingFace + TensorFlow experiment to fine-tune a DistilBERT model for classifying snippets of text as contracts or non-contracts. It uses a small mock dataset of HTML snippets and shows how to preprocess, tokenize, create datasets, and train/evaluate the model.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### 1. **Data Generation and Preprocessing**
- Generates a small dataset of HTML snippets labeled as contract or non-contract.
- Strips HTML tags to convert HTML content into plain text.

#### 2. **Text Tokenization**
- Uses the DistilBERT tokenizer to convert text into token IDs and attention masks.
- Pads and truncates sequences to a fixed maximum length for model input consistency.

#### 3. **Dataset Preparation**
- Packs tokenized inputs and labels into a TensorFlow dataset.
- Shuffles, batches, and splits the dataset into training and testing portions.

#### 4. **Model Loading and Compilation**
- Loads a pretrained DistilBERT model configured for sequence classification with two classes.
- Compiles the model with Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.

#### 5. **Training and Evaluation**
- Runs training for a few epochs, validating on the test set.
- Evaluates the model performance on final test data and prints loss and accuracy.

### Summary

The notebook demonstrates an end-to-end text classification pipeline using a pretrained DistilBERT transformer model within TensorFlow. It covers data preprocessing, tokenization, dataset creation, model fine-tuning, and evaluation on a binary classification task.
